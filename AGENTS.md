# Nasq agent entry point

Read `CLAUDE.md` for the product architecture and engineering rules, then
`docs/WORKSPACE.md` for the workspace and recovery map. Read
`docs/parallel-work.md` before parallel work or changing shared files.
These are repository instructions for every coding agent, regardless of tool.

- Verify the current branch, worktree, and dirty paths before editing. The
  canonical local development checkout is `/Users/tariq/code/nasq` on `main`.
- Develop bounded tasks in temporary `codex/<task>` worktrees based on current
  `main`. Give each task explicit file ownership and independent dependencies,
  generated files, databases, and ports. One orchestrator owns Git integration,
  shared-file edits, runtime changes, and final checks.
- Preserve stock Odoo source. Extend `project` through `nasq_pmo` and `hr`
  through `nasq_hr`. Do not recreate either pillar.
- The HR page is `/hr`; `/api/v1/people` remains the PMO user-id picker. Preserve
  HR documents and the `{items, total}` list envelopes.
- Phase 3b is delivered on the local `codex/phase-3b` branch and remains
  unmerged into canonical `main`. Read its spec, plan, handoff, and delivery
  report under `docs/superpowers/`; archived plans and WIP are reference
  material.
- Never run tests on `odoo19`. Do not commit, merge, push, deploy, remove
  worktrees/branches, or discard work without authorization for that action.
- Local verification does not prove production deployment. Report fresh test
  evidence and the actual branch/runtime state.
