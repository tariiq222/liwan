# webvue_finance

The Finance application over stock `account`, `base_vat` and `l10n_sa`: reads of invoices,
payments, accounts and journals, writes for partners, invoices and payments, the company setup
and the VAT summary.

## Routes (`/api/v1/finance`, lists are `{items, total}` envelopes)

| Route | Capability |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /invoices`, `GET /invoices/<id>` | `finance.invoices.read` |
| `POST /invoices` (201, a draft), `PATCH /invoices/<id>`, `DELETE /invoices/<id>` (204) | `finance.invoices.manage` |
| `POST /invoices/<id>/post`, `/cancel`, `/reset-to-draft` | `finance.invoices.post` |
| `GET /payments` | `finance.payments.read` |
| `POST /payments` (201), `POST /payments/<id>/cancel`, `/reset-to-draft` | `finance.payments.manage` |
| `GET /accounts` | `finance.accounts.read` |
| `GET /journals` | `finance.journals.read` |
| `GET /setup` | `finance.setup.read` |
| `POST /setup/chart`, `PATCH /setup/company`, `PATCH /setup/fiscal` | `finance.setup.manage` |
| `GET /reports/vat?date_from&date_to` | `finance.reports.read` |
| `GET /partners` (`q`, `kind=customer\|vendor`, `archived=true\|false`), `GET /partners/<id>` | `finance.partners.read` |
| `POST /partners` (201), `PATCH /partners/<id>`, `POST /partners/<id>/archive`, `/unarchive` | `finance.partners.manage` |

Every route also requires the `finance.enabled` feature (writes check it as a write). There is
no partner delete: archive instead. Capability dependencies: `partners.manage` needs
`partners.read`; `invoices.manage` needs `invoices.read`; `invoices.post` needs `invoices.manage`;
`payments.manage` needs `payments.read` and `invoices.read`; `setup.manage` needs `setup.read`. The built-in
`finance_manager` role (and `webvue_core`'s vendor support role) holds all twelve capabilities.

## Write semantics

- Request bodies are strict: an unknown key is a 422 `invalid` naming it. Money is a plain JSON
  number, never a string. Records named by id (partner, tax, account, journal, invoices) must be
  visible in the current company, else 422 `invalid` on that field. A path record outside the
  company is a 404.
- Invoices (`out_invoice | in_invoice | out_refund | in_refund`) are created as drafts with at
  least one line `{name, price_unit, quantity=1, discount=0, tax_ids?, account_id?}`. Omitted
  `tax_ids` means the account's default taxes, `[]` means no tax. `currency` is a code and
  defaults to the company currency; `ref` is the customer/bill reference.
- `PATCH` of a draft: a body with `lines` replaces every line, a body without `lines` keeps
  them. The move type cannot change. A non-draft invoice answers 422 `not_draft` to
  `PATCH`, `DELETE` and `post`; `cancel` on a cancelled and `reset-to-draft` on a draft invoice
  answer 422 `invalid_state`.
- `POST /payments` takes `{invoice_ids, amount, payment_date, journal_id, payment_method_line_id?,
  memo?}` and runs Odoo's `account.payment.register` wizard as one batch: the invoices must be
  posted (`not_posted`), of one partner and one currency. `amount` above the open balance is
  422 `amount_exceeds_residual` (Odoo itself would take the overpayment). A payment can be
  cancelled; only a cancelled or rejected one can be reset to draft. The journal must be
  of the invoices' currency (`journal_currency_mismatch`), and the invoices must be of one
  document type, so an invoice and a credit note are never paid together.
- Cancelling or resetting a posted invoice that has reconciled payments is always 422
  `has_payments` (`details.payment_ids`): cancel or reset the payments through the payments
  route first. Receipts can be read but have no write route (404). Line taxes must be of the
  document's kind (sale taxes on customer documents, purchase taxes on vendor ones). Numbers are
  below 10^12 in absolute value; dates are exactly `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Partners exclude Odoo system records: users' partners, the companies' own partners and employee
  work contacts (the stored `employee` flag of hr when hr is installed; no dependency on hr).
  They are 404 on every partner route. A model the caller cannot read at all is 403.
- Odoo refusals are 422 `invalid` with its message, except: `invalid_vat` (partner VAT, checked
  by `base_vat`: Saudi numbers are 15 digits starting and ending with 3; a new partner defaults
  to the company country so the check always has a country), `period_locked` (a lock date covers
  the date; the original text is in `details.detail`; a payment date in a closed period is
  refused up front because Odoo would silently move it) and `zatca_not_onboarded` (posting a
  Saudi sale document is refused while `l10n_sa_edi` is installed and its sales journal is not
  ZATCA-onboarded; Odoo lists every configuration error in one refusal, so other errors may be
  named next to the onboarding one in `details.detail`). No ZATCA onboarding or network call is
  made by this addon.

## Deliberate ORM grant

The routes read and write in the caller's own environment (the only `sudo()` is the setup
elevation below), so each capability
group implies the least stock group that lets the ORM do the operation (documented per group in
`security/finance_capability_groups.xml`):

- the four read capabilities, the setup and report capabilities and `partners.read`:
  `account.group_account_readonly` (partners: nothing, every internal user reads `res.partner`);
- `partners.manage`: `base.group_partner_manager`;
- `invoices.manage`, `invoices.post`, `payments.manage`: `account.group_account_invoice`.

`account.group_account_manager` is never implied. Consequence: the stock groups are broader than
the capabilities (any write capability allows ORM writes on every invoice and payment), so only
the route gates per capability (`tests/test_finance_capability_isolation.py`,
`tests/test_finance_write_access.py`). The same approach is used by `webvue_hr`
(`hr.group_hr_user`).

The capability split is route-level and relies on the pending closing of Odoo's generic ORM
endpoints, which would otherwise let the broader stock groups act directly.

## Setup and VAT report routes

- `GET /setup`: `finance.setup.read`. Chart, company tax identity, fiscal settings, journal and tax counts,
  ZATCA readiness, `ready` and stable `blockers` codes (`chart_not_loaded`, `vat_15_tax_missing`,
  `company_vat_missing`, `company_registry_missing`, `company_address_incomplete`, `zatca_not_onboarded`)
- `POST /setup/chart` (loads the Saudi `sa` chart, 422 `chart_already_loaded` when one is loaded),
  `PATCH /setup/company` (`vat`, `company_registry`, `street`, `city`, `state_id`, `country_id`) and
  `PATCH /setup/fiscal` (`fiscalyear_last_day`, `fiscalyear_last_month`, the sale, purchase, tax and
  global lock dates; never the irreversible hard lock date): `finance.setup.manage` (needs
  `finance.setup.read`); each returns the full setup status
- `GET /reports/vat?date_from&date_to`: `finance.reports.read`. Per tax base and tax amount for sales
  and purchases of the posted entries of the current company, and `net_payable` (output minus input VAT)

## Setup elevation (documented `sudo()` cases)

Stock refuses `account.chart.template` loads to non-administrators and `res.company` writes without the
Access Rights group. After the route's `finance.setup.manage` check, `webvue.finance.setup` elevates in
exactly two methods, the R7 case "finance setup (chart load, company tax identity)":

1. `_webvue_load_chart`: loads the Saudi template `sa` only, into the current company (`env.company`).
   It refuses (422) when a chart is loaded (`chart_already_loaded`), the company has branches
   (`company_has_branches`, stock recurses into them) or it already has journal entries.
2. `_webvue_write_company`: writes the current company only, restricted to a field whitelist
   (`vat`, `company_registry`, `street`, `city`, `state_id`, `country_id` and the fiscal year day/month and
   the four non-hard lock dates). Any other field, including `hard_lock_date`, raises `AccessError`.

Through `PATCH /setup/fiscal` a lock date can only be tightened (set, or moved later); removing or
moving one earlier is 422 `lock_date_loosening`, done by an accounting administrator in Odoo. Stock
`RedirectWarning`s (for example unreconciled bank lines before a lock date) become 422 `invalid`
without the action link. Changing only `country_id` re-validates the existing `state_id` (422 on `state_id`).

Both re-check that the record is the current company. Reads, validation and serializers stay in the
caller's environment. A caller without `finance.setup.manage` gets 403 and nothing changes
(`tests/test_finance_setup.py`).

## VAT report scope

`GET /reports/vat` groups posted journal items per individual tax: a group tax appears as its child
taxes, cash-basis taxes count at the invoice date, and only the current company is read (not branches).

## ZATCA readiness is read-only

`serializers/zatca.py` reports, from stock `l10n_sa_edi` data when that module is installed
(`{installed: false}` otherwise): the API mode, whether a private key exists, and per sale journal
`onboarded` and `state` (`not_started`, `compliance_checked`, `onboarded`). Key material, CSR, CSIDs
and tokens are never read into the shape (`tests/test_finance_zatca.py` scans every output for
secret-like keys and values). No onboarding action and no network call exist here.

## VAT summary source

The Saudi 'VAT Return' (`l10n_sa.tax_report_vat_filing`) is data only in Community: the `account.report`
engine that evaluates its `tax_tags` expressions ships with Enterprise `account_reports`. The summary
therefore groups posted `account.move.line` rows with `_read_group` (base by `tax_ids` on product lines,
tax by `tax_line_id`), signed as a return reads. A reverse-charge tax shows its base and a net tax of
zero.
